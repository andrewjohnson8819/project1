Project1 User Stories for game of War
--------------------------------------
I should be able to clearly see the name of the game and its rules so I can understand how to play.

I should be able to influence when my turn is taken so I control the pace of the game. (buttons)

I should be able to see the results of each turn displayed on screen so I can see what I chose and who will win each turn.

I should be able to reset the game when I run out of options so I can play more than once.

I should be able to hit my card generator button repeatedly in event of a tie so that subsequent cards declare a winner.

I should be able to follow how many points each player has throughout the game so I can follow who is winning.

I should be able to choose a one player game vs random AI or a two player game so I can play against a friend.

If have time, add in lyrics from Edwin Starr's 'War' when players win or lose.

Rules
---------
Ver1: Each player has a random selection of 26 cards taken from a single deck of playing cards.  Each player places one card face up.  The higher card wins the round and both cards are discarded.  The winning player is tallied one point to their score and play continues as such until all 26 cards per deck are used.  In the event of a tie, both cards are discarded and neither player receives a point (or both players receive a point).

Ver2: Same as above but when a player wins a round they take both cards and return them to their own deck to be played again later.  The game ends when one side is out of cards to play.  

Ver3: In the event of a tie the button is hit again and both players play another card until the round ends in a winner.  All cards can be discarded through Ver1 or all cards go to the winning player as in Ver2.
