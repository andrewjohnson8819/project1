Project1 User Stories for game of War
--------------------------------------
I should be able to clearly see the name of the game and its rules so I can understand how to play.

I should be able to influence when my turn is taken so I control the pace of the game. (buttons)

I should be able to see the results of each turn displayed on screen so I can see what I chose and who will win each turn.

I should be able to follow how many points each player has throughout the game so I can follow who is winning.

I should be able to reset the game when I run out of options so I can play more than once.

I should be able to choose a one player game vs random AI or a two player game so I can play against a friend.
